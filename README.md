# Projects
This repository is a way to document the growth I've made starting as a self-taught developer to a formally educated experienced software engineer.

It is organized into three separate sections:

 - Desktop Applications
 - Mobile Applications
 - Web Applications
 
The desktop and mobile applications have been developed with .Net and Xamarin.Forms.
The web applications are full-stack applications using the MERN stack.
